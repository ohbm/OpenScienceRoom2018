# Open Science Room 2018

***Schedule and resources from the OHBM Open Science Room: Singapore 2018***

***The official Twitter hashtag set of the Open Science Room for 2018 is [#OHBM2018 #OSR](https://twitter.com/search?q=%20%23OSR%20%23OHBM2018&src=typd). Use it to coordinate events, meetings and discussions!***

### Open daily June 17-21 from 8:00 – 19:00
### ROOM: 311

The Open Science SIG has organized the *Open Science Room* that will be available through the meeting to all OHBM attendees to discuss, present, learn, and collaborate in the spirit of Open Science. Over the lunch breaks are scheduled a series of software focused presentations by developers of current neuroimaging analysis packages to provide an overview on the newest software releases and latest developments. All attendees are welcome to stay beyond the 15-20 minute demonstrations to ask questions and work with each other to improve their understanding of these tools. You are invited to come by at any time to learn more about open science, how you can get involved, or to use the space to interact with your colleagues. See below, or check the mobile app, for the scheduled demonstrations to stay updated on all the community lead initiatives.
